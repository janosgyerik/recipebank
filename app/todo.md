Clean code:

- review and rename search_key / search properties (should be display_name?)
- better abstractions and encapsulation
- automated tests
- CI/CD with analysis on SonarCloud

Easier to use:

- highlight ingredients that are part of the filter
- add ingredient photos, and use them in recipe cards
- exclude from ingredient selector what was already selected
